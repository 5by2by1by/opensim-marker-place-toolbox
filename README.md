# OpenSim Marker Placement Toolbox
This repository contains the scripts and sample data for a motion capture marker placement refinement algorithm based on minimizing inverse kinematics tracking errors. 

For the algorithm scripts and wrapper function templates, see the [AutoPlace folder](AutoPlace).
